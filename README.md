## Project Name
### Webpage based "app" utilising API to determine MRT route
This web app is meant to help people route their journey through Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit/Metro Rail Transit (MRT). Users choose a starting station and an ending station and the website would generate a route that the user would follow.

## Design Process
### Initial Thoughts
Despite the decision to purposefully choose what seemed like an "easier" topic after the disaster that was Assignment 1, I somehow still managed to bite off more than I can chew. It is even worse this time; I somehow though creating an MRT route was going to be "simple". No API for MRT stations even exist. Wonderous.

That leads me to creating the database myself (as suggested by my lecturer), but how do I even do that???

The users of the web app would most likely be tourists (most unfamiliar with MRT), thus the web app should be clear and explain any terms that the users may not understand.
> As a tourist, I would like to be able to plot out a MRT route, so traversing via MRT would be easier

> As a tourist, I would like any unfamilar terms to be explained to me, so I can better understand the system

## TBA Features
- [ ] Generate a path based on the user's input
- [ ] Indicate what interchanges to use if needed
- [ ] State the line(s) the Station is on
- [ ] Store previous paths in localstorage for future use?

## Added Features
(NIL)

## Tech Used
* HTML Boilerplate (Visual Studio)
* Bootstrap Templates?
* Some API (May have to be self generated...)

## Test Runs
