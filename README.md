## Repository for Assignment 2 for Interactive Devlopment
Github Page Link: (Insert link here)
## Project Name: 
Webpage based "app" utilising API to determine MRT route
This web app is meant to help people route their journey through Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit/Metro Rail Transit (MRT). Users choose a starting station and an ending station and the website would generate a route that the user would follow.

## Design Proccess
Despite the decision to purposefully choose what seemed like an "easier" topic after the disaster that was Assignment 1, I somehow still managed to bite off more than I can chew. It is even worse this time, somehow I though creating an MRT route was going to be "simple". No API for MRT stations even exist. Wonderous.

## TBA Features
- [ ] Generate MRT path based on input
- [ ] Store previous paths in localstorage for future use?

## Added Features
(NIL)

## Tech Used
*HTML Boilerplate (Visual Studio)
*Bootstrap Templates?
*Some API (May have to be self generated...)

## Test Runs
